Clutch has a proprietary research methodology to evaluate companies in solutions and various service sectors. The components are both quantitative and qualitative, including the scope of a company’s services, as well as their work experience and market presence. High on the list, however, is client experience. Analysts at Clutch speak directly with a company’s clients to determine the services provided, as well as to capture the client’s outlook on project management, cost, and other factors relevant to the collaboration. The reviews resulting from this process are comprehensive and insightful for prospective buyers.

## Clients say we deliver on Clutch

Since creating a [profile](https://clutch.co/profile/kodo-labs) on Clutch, we have asked a few of our clients to share their experiences. Client feedback helps maintain accountability and provide optimal customer service.   

The principal of a design agency, with whom we have worked on a number of different projects, rated their overall experience 5/5 stars, and shared with Clutch:

“All of our products have been delivered on time with high quality that has exceeded our expectations.”

It’s helpful to have a third-party confirm that our skill and work ethic have resulted in strong products for our clients. We hope that by having verified reviews, buyers in search of skilled developers will be encouraged to use our services. Overall, we’re grateful for our presence on the site among so many reputable web development companies, and anticipate many future opportunities to come from our partnership with Clutch!
